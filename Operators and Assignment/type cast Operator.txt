type cast Operator
==========================================================================================

It is of 2 types:
1) Implicit Type-Casting:
    i) Compiler is responsible to perform implicit type Casting.

    ii)Whenever we are assigning smaller data type value to bigger data type variable implicit type casting 
    will be performed.

    iii)It is also known as widening or upcasting.

    iv)There is no loss of information in this type casting.

    The following are various possible conversion where implicit type casting will be performed:
    byte-->short-->int-->long-->float-->double.
    char-->int-->long-->float-->double.

    Example 1:
    int x = 'a';    
    Sopen(x);   //97   compiler converts char to int automatically by implicit type casting

    Example 2:
    double d = 10;
    Sopen(d);     //10.0    compiler converts int to long automatically by implicit type casting

2) Explicity Type-Casting:
    i) Programmer is responsible to perform explicit type casting whenever we are assigning bigger data type value to smaller data type variable
    then explicit type casting is required.
    ii) It is also known as narrowing or downcasting.
    iii) There may be a chance of loss of information in this type casting.

    The following are various possibilities where explicit type casting is required :
    byte<--short<--int<---long<---float<--double
    char<--int<---long<---float<--double


    Example 1:
    int x = 130;
    byte b = x;     //possible loss of precison found int required byte

    byte b = (byte)x;
    Sopen(b);    //-126 

    Whenever we are assigning bigger data type value to smaller data type variable by explicit type casting
    the most significant bit will be lost we have to consider only Least significant bits.

    Example 2:
     
    int x = 150;
    short s = (short)x;
    Sopen(s);   // 150 

    byte b = (byte)x;
    Sopen(b);   // -106

    Example 3:
    If we assign floating point value to the integral types by expliccit type casting the digits after the
    decimal points will be lost.
    double d = 130.234;
    int x = (int)d;        
    Sopen(x)        //130

    byte b = (byte)d;
    Sopen(b);       //-126

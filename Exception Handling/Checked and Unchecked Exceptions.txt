Checked Exception VS Unchecked Exception
=====================================================================================================
**Most Important

The Exceptions which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of the program are called checked
exeception.Example: HallTicketMissingException, PenNotWorkingExeption,FileNotFoundException etc.

Remeber : mom and son examination example

In our program if there is a chance of rising checked Exception then compulsory we should handle that 
checked exeption(either by try-catch or by throws keyword) otherwise we will get compile time error.

Example:
public class p6
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");        //there might be case that this file will not be present at its location
        pw.println("Hello");
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
}

//the above program will thows an exception at compile time because there may be a chance of a chance of FileNotFoundException.
//and we havn't handled that exception




The exceptions which are not checked by compiler whether programmer handling or not such type of exceptions are called Unchecked exceptions.
Example:
1)ArithmaticException
2)BombBlastException .. etc

Rember : Example of father,son and grandfather related to marriage

Note:
1)Whether it is checked or Unchecked every exception occurs at runtime only.
2)There is no chance of occuring any exception at compile time.


Note:
Runtime Exception and its child classes, Error and its child classes are unchecked except this remaining are checked exception.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fully Checked VS Partially Checked
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remeber: parent and child mall and parent and child airport example

A checked is said to be fully checked if and only if all its child classes also checked.
Example:
IOException,InterruptedException,ServeletException etc.

A checked exception is said to be Partially checked if and only if some of its child classes are
unchecked.
Example:
Exception and Throwable etc.

Note: The only possible Partially checked exceptions in java are Exception and Throwable.


Describe the behaviour of following exceptions:
1)IOException       //checked Exception,fully checked exception
2)RuntimeException      //Unchecked Exception
3)InterruptedException      //checked Exception , fully checked exception
4)Error         //Unchecked Exception
5)Throwable         //Partially checked exception
6)ArithmaticException       //unchecked exception
7)NullPointerException      //unchecked exception
8)Exception         //Partially checked exception
9)FileNotFoundException         //Fully checked exception

Top-10 Exceptions
=====================================================================================================

Based on the person who is rising an exception all exceptions are divided into 2 types:
1)JVM Exceptions
2)Programmatic Exceptions

---------------------------------
JVM Exceptions
---------------------------------
The exceptions which are rised automatically by JVM whenever a particular event occur are called
JVM exceptions.
Example :
    1)Arithmatic exceptions
    2)NULL pointer exception ..etc 


------------------------------------
Programmatic Exceptions
-------------------------------------
The exception which are rised explicitly either by programmer or api developer to indicate that
something got wrong are called programmatic exceptions.
Example:
    TooOldExceptions
    IllegalArgumentException ...etc


1)ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException 
    It is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to access array elements with out of 
    range index.
    Example:
    int [] x = new int[4];
    Sopen(x[0]);   //0
    Sopen(x[10]);   //re:ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
    Sopen(x[-10]);   //re:ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException

2)NullPointerException
    It is the child class of runtime exception and hence it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to perform any operation on NULL.
    Example:
    String e=null;
    System.out.println(e.length());

3)ClassCastException
    It is child class of runtime exception and it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to typecast parent object to child type.
    String s = new String("Suraj");
    Object o = (Object)s;       //valid

    Object o = new Object();
    String s = (String)o;    //this is invalid ClassCastException

    Object o = new String("suraj")
    String s = (String)o;   //valid 

4)StackOverFlowError
    It is a child class of Error and hence it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM whenever we are trying to perform recursive method call.
    Example:
    class Test 
    {
        p s v m1()
        {
            m2();
        }
        p s v m2()
        {
            m1();
        }
        p s void main(String[] args)
        {
            m1();
        }
    }

5)NoClassDefFoundError
    It is a child class of error and hence it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM whenever JVM unable to find required .class file.
    Example:
    java Test   //if Test.class file is not available then we will get runtime exception saying NoClassDefFound Error.


6)ExceptionInInitializerError
    It is a child class of error and hence it is unchecked.
    Rised automatically by JVM if any exception occurs while excecuting static variable assignment and static blocks.
    Example: 

    class CustomExceptionDemo
    {
        
        static
        {
            String s = null;
            System.out.println(s.length());
        }
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        }
    }

    class CustomExceptionDemo
    {
        static int x = 10/0;
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            
            
        }
    }
    //above both code will give ExceptionInInitializerError.


7)IllegalArgumentException

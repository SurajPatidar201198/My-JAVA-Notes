An unexpected unwanted event that distrurbs the normal flow of the program is called as Exception.
Example:
1)Type punchured Exception
2)Sleeping exception 
3)FileNotFoundException

It is highly recommended to handle exception and the main objective of exception handling is graceful
termination of the program.

Exception handling doesn't mean repairing an exception we have to provide an alternative way to 
continue rest of the program is the concept of exception handling.

For Example : our programming requirement is to read the data from remote file locating at london
at runtime is not available our program should not be terminated abnormally we have to provide
some local file to continue rest of the program normally.This way of defining alternative is nothing
but exception handling.

Example:
try
{
    //read data from remote file loacting at london
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
    //use local file and continue rest of the program normally
}

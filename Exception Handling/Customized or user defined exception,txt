Customized or user defined exception
================================================================================================

Sometimes to meet programming requirments we can define our own exceptions such type of exception are called
Customized or user defined exceptions.

Example: TooYoungException
         TooOldException
         InSufficientFundException

Example: 

//defining customized exceptions 

class TooYoungException extends RuntimeException
{
    TooYoungException(String s)
    {
        super(s);
    }
}
class TooOldException extends RuntimeException
{
    TooOldException(String s)
    {
        super(s);
    }
}
class CustomExceptionDemo
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        if(age>60)
        {
            throw new TooYoungException("Please wait some more time you eill get best match");
        }
        else if(age<18)
        {
            throw new TooOldException("Your age already crossed marriage age and no chance of getting marriage");
        }
        else 
        {
            System.out.println("You will get matched details soon by email");
        }
    }
}

Note :
1)Throw keyword is best suitable for user defined or customized exceptions but not for pre-defined exceptions.
2)It is highly recommended to define customized exceptions as unchecked i.e we have to extends runtime exceptions
but not exceptions. Because if we extends checked exception then it will give compile time exception.
Remeber exception is also checked exception.

3)super(s) is required to make  our description available to default exception handler.

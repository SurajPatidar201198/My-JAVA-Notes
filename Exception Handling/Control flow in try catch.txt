Control flow in try catch
===============================================================================================
try
{
    statement 1;
    statement 2;
    statement 3;
}
catch
{
    statement 4;
}
statement 5;

Case 1: If there is no exception: 1,2,3,5  Normal Termination

Case 2: If an exception rised at statement2 and corresponding catch block matched. 1,4,5  Normal Termination

Case 3: If an exception rised at statement2 and corresponding catch block not matched. 1, abnormal termination

Case 4: If an exception rised at statement4 or statement5 then it is always abnormal termination.

*Note: Within the try block if any where exception rised then rest of the try block won't be executed even 
though we handled the exception.Hence withing the try block we have to take only risky code and length of try
block as less as possible.

*Note: In addition to try block there may be a chance of rising exception inside catch and finally block.

*Note: If any statement which is not part of try block and rises an exception then it is always abnormal termination.
